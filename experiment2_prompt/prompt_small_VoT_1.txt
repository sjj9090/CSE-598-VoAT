In a 3×3×3 space, stacking blocks are arranged.
You will receive 3 different views, front view, side view, and top view that show the block arrangement from each side. (❌=empty space, ⬜=block)
Your goal is to understand the block arrangement and count the total number of stacking blocks in the grid.
A block cannot be placed in mid-air; it needs a solid block underneath.
Total count is your final output.

To count them accurately, you need to visualize the distribution of blocks on each layer.
In this problem each layer is a 3×3 grid.
VISUALIZE EACH FLOOR, 1F, 2F, 3F!
This is a visualization example.

<3F>
❌❌❌3F
❌⬜❌2F
❌❌❌1F
1A 2A 3A

Now This is the given problem.
