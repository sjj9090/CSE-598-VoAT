In a space, stacking blocks are arranged.
You will receive 3 different views, front view, side view, and top view that show the block arrangement from each side. (❌=empty space, ⬜=block)
Your goal is to understand the block arrangement and count the total number of stacking blocks in the grid.
A block cannot be placed in mid-air; it needs a solid block underneath.
Total count is your final output.

To count them accurately, you need to visualize the distribution of blocks on each layer.
VISUALIZE EACH FLOOR, 1F, 2F, 3F, 4F!
This is a visualization example.

<3F>
❌❌❌❌4B
❌❌❌❌3B
❌⬜❌❌2B
❌❌❌❌1B
1A 2A 3A 4A

Now This is the given problem.
