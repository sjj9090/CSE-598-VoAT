You can choose one of four movements at each step:
["right", "down", "left", "up","climb","drop"]
"right", "down", "left", "up" is the movement in same level, and "climb","drop" is movement between the different level.
Inter-floor movement is only allowed if the corresponding position is a valid path (non-obstacle) on both floors.
Moving to upper level (ex 1F->2F) is climb, and moving to lower level (ex 2F->1F) is drop.
You can only move one square at a time.

Provide length of the movement to reach the destination.
